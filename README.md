# Transportation Analysis
### A SQL Analysis by Ogechi Maryann Okafor

A colleague of mine had an intent of going into transportation business. He needed information that will enable him start on a good note without bias. As a data analyst, I conducted a research by creating and distributing a survey form to know people's prefered choice of transportation and how much they're willing to pay for it.

### The Analysis
After collecting the survey form, I cleaned the dataset with Excel and uploaded it to MySQL for further analysis. 
I queried the dataset to know most prefered choice of transportation, the gender that traveled the most and how much they're willing to pay.

After this analysis, the insight stated that the most prefered choice was road transportation. Presenting this findings to my colleague enabled him to make informed decision.
